This is an affordable mini CNC mill built from Ender 3 parts. It’s suitable for tasks such as milling, engraving, drawing, and PCB fabrication. The machine is driven by NEMA 17 motors, belts, and two lead screws. It uses an old Dremel that I had lying around as a spindle, and I'm currently working on making an enclosure out of plywood and an acrylic front door. It use klipper software to run, with a "Klipperized" post-processor to make work on Fusion 360 CAM. Credit to @IMLAB, @SGD_Knuffel, and the team at Ender CNC for providing most of the printables. I used a mix of those files to create an Ender-3 CNC that I felt was most optimized. I also hope to continue working on improving those files in the coming weeks and possibly even mill the sides out of aluminum. Other than using those files, I did not follow any specific guide and did everything else myself.
